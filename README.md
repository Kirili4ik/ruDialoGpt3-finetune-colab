# ruDialoGpt3-finetune-colab
This is a colab-ready-for-use tutorial for finetuning ruDialoGpt3 model on your telegram chat using HuggingFace and Pytorch


Here is a ready-to-run code for fine-tuning a RuDialoGPT3 model using HuggingFace and PyTorch on your telegram chat.

I used RuDialoGPT-3 trained on forums to fine tune. It was trained by @Grossmend on Russian forums. The training process took 12 days using 4x RTX 2080 Ti (2 epochs on 32GB text corpus). The training procedure of GPT-3 for dialogue is described in Grossmend's blogpost (in Russian).

If you want just to try / to talk to my fine-tuned model than go straight to the Inference section.
